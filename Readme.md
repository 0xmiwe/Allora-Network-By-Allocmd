Use faucet to receive uallo: (Wallet address addressin the command above 
Each topic when running for the first time the worker will send a tx to register that topic so uallo is needed to send the tx.
Go to https://faucet.testnet-1.testnet.allora.network/ to receive uallo. Faucet is successful as shown below:
